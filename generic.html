									Digital Design
									</h1>
									<p>A FPGA Project</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/FPGABoard.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>A semester long (4 months) project. Worked in groups of four students to develop a software on the FPGA board.
									We came up with a game called Bomb Tag which is a four player game where a player will be a designated bomber that holds that bomb.
									After the bomb explode, the player holding the bomb dies and the bomb is randomly passed on to the next person. However, if the bomber passes
									the bomb to another play before the bomb explodes, the other person become the bomber. This continues until the timer runs out and only one player is left standing.
									Since it is a four player game, we use four different FPGA boards so that four players can play the game and control one board each player.
									To implement this feature, we make the FPGA board communicate with each other using UART.
								
								</p>
								<p>
									Another feature this game has is a physics animation where the player will have to jump around the platform and has the ability to fall on either the platforms
									or the ground due to gravity.
								</p>

									<h1>CP2106 (Orbital)<br />
									Independent Software Development Project</h1>
									<p>NUqueSt</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/nuquest.png" alt="" /></div>
								<p>
									Orbital is a famous project (groups of two) in NUS which most of the computing students in NUS participate in.
								</p>
								<p>
									My partner and I developed a game called NUqueSt using Unity Engine. This game is inspired by Stardew Valley and Animal Crossing.
									The purpose of this game is to introduce freshmen in NUS to the modules of NUS in a comedic manner. Although that is the main purpose of the game,
									a regular person who is not a freshmen or not even a student from NUS can play this game due to a wide range of puzzles.
								</p>
								<p>
									One feature of this game is the AI system in this game. The AI used by the enemy characters has a unique player chasing and obstacle avoidance algorithm.
									It uses simple concept of linear algebra to achieve this algorithm
									This will overall give the AI, a more natural movement that could replicate an actual chase.
								</p>
								<p>
									Another feature is the software development practices that we use. We use OOP to structure our code for ease of refinement. Version control such as GitHub was used to maintain
									source code management. Many Project Management concepts like issue trackers, milestones, agile methods, scrum were applied. Numerous forms of testing such as unit testing, integration
									testing and system testings were consistently done to ensure the game is bug-free.

								A 4 man projct to develop a remote control robot that can navigate through a maze
							</p>
							<p>
								Using the concepts we learnt from the module such as communication protocol, arduino programming, lidar programming and other hardware peripherals 
								we designed a robot that can navigate around a maze remotely. The purpose of the project is to assess how well the robot can be controlled remotely while achieving different tasks like color identification
								and obstacles mapping using Lidar.
